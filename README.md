# Basic setup to build a npm package

- 📦 [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- 📝 [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- 💻 [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- 💅 [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Commands

1. `start` - start the development process
2. `build` - build for production
3. `test` - run the tests once
4. `test:watch` - run the tests in watch mode

## Description

A very basic (by design) setup for creating npm packages. Edit the `index.ts` file with your functionality, write some tests if you want, `build` and ship it. Bundles using Parcel, meaning you can extend it if you need to or just leave it as is.
